## A real time weather app using a json file hosting the city you want

Hello everybody ! This is a project for an interface that does not include a search engine for weather location. However, it includes a configuration file (JSON) in which the information of the city concerned can be entered by you. It will be used by a JavaScript code so that the correct information is transmitted. This code also includes an HTML file for the display structure, a css file for the design, and two images that represent humidity and wind speed.
